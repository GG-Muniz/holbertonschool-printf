## Description

The functions _printf main focus is to print an output according to a certain format. Different ways to print an output is with the use of a format specifier.

### What is format specifier?

A format specifier in c are used to take input and print the output of a type. The symbol we use in every format specifier is %. The specifier tells the compiler about the type of data that most be given or input and the type of data that most be printed on the screen.

| Format Specifier | Used for...                                                   |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| %%               | Write a function that returns the sum of all its parameters.  |
| %i, %d           | Write a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line. |
| %s               | Write a function that prints strings, followed by a new line. |
| %c               | Write a function that prints anything.                        |

### Return Value
Upon successful return, these functions return the number of character printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to string). If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.

## Technology
The function has been created usin: 
* C language
* Ubuntu Terminal - Linux OS
* GitHub

### Compilation
All the files that were used are compiled using:
`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c`

## Challenges
The challenges we faced are the following:

* Time Management, conflict with the real life excenario and fear of failing in the project by any tecnical error.
* The creation of the function that prints intergers and formats strings.
* Trying to create a function with the little information that was given. 

Solving these challenges helped us to develop critical thinking and emphasize collaboration.
